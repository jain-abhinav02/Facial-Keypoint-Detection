# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
This repository contains the code to get you started with the facial keypoint detection challenge on Kaggle. This challenge is useful for beginners to try out different CNN models. We can even use transfer learning with the help of pretrained networks such as VGG16, ResNet50 etc. One can learn a lot about image visualisation and augmenting with this dataset.
